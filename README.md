# GTAW Furniture Catalog

A simple web app I made to help GTA World players find furniture more easily. No more guessing prop names or digging through forums!

Here's what you can do:

- Browse furniture with filters (categories, tags, search)
- Save your favorites for quick access later
- Create collections to organize furniture by project or theme
- Share your collections with others
- Submit new furniture or suggest fixes if something's wrong
- Copy `/sf` commands with one click

Just need a GTA World account to get started!

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Privacy is important, so the application is designed to collect minimal data. Here's what it stores:

**What it stores:**
- Your GTA World username (from the login)
- Your favorite furniture items
- Your collections and submissions

**What it doesn't store:**
- Email addresses
- Passwords (that's all handled by GTA World)
- IP addresses
- Anything else personal

The application follows GTA World's website regulations and only uses their official OAuth system for login. Standard security practices are implemented (preventing SQL injection, XSS protection, CSRF tokens, secure sessions) — you can see all of this in the source code if you want to check.

---

## 🎯 Why Open Source?

The source code is publicly available for transparency and community feedback:

- **🔍 Transparency** — You can see exactly what the app does and what data it stores
- **🔒 Security** — Anyone can review the code for security issues
- **🤝 Trust** — You can verify how your data is handled
- **💡 Feedback** — You can report bugs and suggest improvements
- **📚 Learning** — If you're curious about how it works, feel free to explore!

This repository is published for transparency purposes. The code is available for review and learning, but the primary way to use the application is through the hosted version at **[https://gtawfur.nctrn.cc/](https://gtawfur.nctrn.cc/)**.

---

## 🛠️ For Developers

If you're curious about how this works, feel free to explore the code! The application is built with PHP, MySQL, and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks or external dependencies, keeping things simple and straightforward.

**Code Structure:**
- Backend logic lives in `includes/` — database connections, authentication, data processing
- Frontend JavaScript is in `js/` — all the interactive features
- Templates are in `templates/` — the HTML structure
- Styles are in `css/` — everything that makes it look nice

The codebase is intentionally simple and well-commented, so if you're interested in learning how it works or want to contribute, feel free to dive in! You'll find comments throughout explaining what different parts do.

**Important:** This repository is published **for transparency and review purposes only**. The application is exclusively hosted at **[https://gtawfur.nctrn.cc/](https://gtawfur.nctrn.cc/)**. **Do not set up your own instance** — we do not support, provide assistance for, or endorse separate deployments.
